# Embedded Machine Learning (College - S1 - 2025)

Welcome to my **Embedded Machine Learning** repository — an open and experimental documentation  
of my academic journey in exploring how **Machine Learning meets embedded systems**.

---

## 🧠 Overview
This repository covers theoretical materials, experiments, prototypes, exhibitions, and  
literature studies related to deploying AI on resource-limited devices such as microcontrollers  
and IoT nodes. It also explores the **social impact** of embedded intelligence in daily life.
